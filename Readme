Working with Selenium for the first time was a lot of fun, and was surprisingly straightforward to use.
I had some issues with my maven installation but it is now working!
I am sure that there are better ways to name and do things, so I look forward to hear about suggestions and improvements.
I did not yet do the Optional task, but will look into that in the next days. But I think it should be relatively straightforward as a java function using selenium.
